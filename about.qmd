Welcome to my journey. A place where I document the things I’m learning, unlearning, questioning, and exploring. I’m walking a path shaped by my **think pieces, food statistics and** **epidemiology**.

Here, I dive into:

**Statistics in Food** — making sense of data behind what we eat and how it’s produced.

**Statistics in Epidemiology & Health** — understanding patterns, risks, and the numbers that influence public health decisions.

**Think Pieces** — reflections on life, purpose, growth, and the world around me.

This blog is my evolving notebook — a place where curiosity leads, insights grow, and new interests join the journey as they come. We’ll learn, reflect, and discover together.

So… walk with me.\
