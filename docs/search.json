A place where I document the things I’m learning, unlearning, questioning, and exploring.\nI’m walking a path shaped by my think pieces, food statistics and epidemiology. Here, I dive into:\n\nStatistics in Food — making sense of data behind what we eat and how it’s produced.\nStatistics in Epidemiology & Health — understanding patterns, risks, and the numbers that influence public health decisions.\nNutritional Health — exploring how food shapes well-being, communities, and everyday choices.\nThink Pieces — reflections on life, purpose, growth, and the world around me.\n\nThis blog is my evolving notebook — a place where curiosity leads, insights grow, and new interests join the journey as they come.\nSo… walk with me.\nWe’ll learn, reflect, and discover together."
