    "text": "Welcome to my journey. A place where I document the things I’m learning, unlearning, questioning, and exploring. I’m walking a path shaped by my think pieces, food statistics and epidemiology.\nHere, I dive into:\nStatistics in Food: making sense of data behind what we eat and how it’s produced.\nStatistics in Epidemiology & Health: understanding patterns, risks, and the numbers that influence public health decisions.\nThink Pieces: reflections on life, purpose, growth, and the world around me.\nThis blog is my evolving notebook — a place where curiosity leads, insights grow, and new interests join the journey as they come. We’ll learn, reflect, and discover together.\nSo… walk with me."
